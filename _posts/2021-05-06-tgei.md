The age-old question *“nature vs nurture”* still fascinates us. Do we inherit only DNA from our parents, or do their experiences leave marks that we pass on too? Modern science shows it’s not one or the other — traits like height, disease risk, stress response emerge from a complex mix of genes, environment, and possibly inherited epigenetic changes. Below, I explore what we *do* know about trans-generational epigenetic inheritance, what remains unproven, and where recent research is pointing.

### Heritability, epigenetics, and transgenerational effects

- **Heritability** refers to how much of the variation in a trait (like eye colour, height, or disease risk) can be attributed to inherited genetic differences.  
- **Epigenetics** are biochemical modifications to DNA or its associated proteins (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs) that affect gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence.  
- **Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI)** means those epigenetic changes acquired during one generation are passed via the germline (egg/sperm) to future generations, influencing their traits.

### What is known: examples & the Dutch famine

One of the most cited human examples is the **Dutch famine** (1944-45). Women exposed to severe malnutrition during pregnancy had children who later showed increased risks for obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders compared to those not exposed. Scholars have proposed that epigenetic changes in response to famine may partly explain these effects.  

But key caveats remain:  
1. **In utero/pregnancy effects** — malnutrition during pregnancy directly affects the developing fetus (nutrient supply, hormone milieu, etc.), making it hard to separate what is inherited via germline vs what’s a developmental effect.  
2. **Reprogramming in germ cells** — mammalian germlines (and early embryos) undergo waves of epigenetic “reset” (erasure + re-establishment of epigenetic marks). This tends to remove many acquired epigenetic changes, which limits how much of an acquired epigenetic state can be passed on.

3. **Confounding social/enviro/cultural inheritance** — non-biological factors (diet, stress, culture, parenting) are often shared across generations and can mimic what looks like epigenetic inheritance.

### What recent research adds

Recent studies continue to refine our understanding and suggest that while TEI in humans remains unproven, there *are* some promising directions:

- A 2024 critical review by **Adrian Bird** emphasizes that evidence in vertebrates (especially mammals) is still inconclusive: many studies show correlation, but few definitively demonstrate germline passage of epigenetic marks.  [oai_citation:1‡Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/epigenetics-and-epigenomics/articles/10.3389/freae.2024.1434253/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- In 2024, **Murase et al.** developed in vitro models of human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) that undergo epigenetic reprogramming in culture (demethylation + reshaping of histone marks). This helps show *how* germline reprogramming happens and provides tools to test which epigenetic states can evade erasure.  [oai_citation:2‡Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07526-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Studies on **trauma and early adversity** (in human observational cohorts) are improving. A 2025 review on trauma’s epigenetic effects points to potential transgenerational impacts (on stress-related genes like *NR3C1*, *FKBP5*), but underscores that environment and social transmission remain major confounders.  [oai_citation:3‡MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/7/3075?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Animal model work continues to show stronger TEI effects for some exposures (toxins, diet), but again, the strength and permanence vary and often don’t fully carry over past one or two generations under rigorous controls.

### What we *don’t* know yet / what to be cautious about

- Whether *specific* acquired epigenetic changes from adult life (stress, diet, trauma) are reliably passed down in humans beyond just intergenerational effects (i.e. parent → child).  
- Which epigenetic marks are most capable of evading germline reprogramming (some imprinted regions, some transposable elements may escape erasure better).  [oai_citation:5‡The Open Biotechnology Journal](https://openbiotechnologyjournal.com/VOLUME/10/PAGE/36/FULLTEXT/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- How much of transgenerational effects attributed to epigenetics are actually due to persistent environmental/cultural conditions (diet, socioeconomic status, behaviors) that persist across generations.  

---

### Why this matters

If TEI turns out to have strong effects in humans, implications are big:

- Preventive medicine would need to consider not just your genes or environment *now*, but maybe your parents’ and grandparents’ exposures.  
- Public health might prioritize interventions even earlier — before conception or across generations.  
- Ethical, social, and equity issues become even more important (who is exposed to adversity, who suffers the consequences, etc.).

---

### Bottom line

As of 2025:

- There’s **strong evidence** that epigenetic changes respond to environment, and that germline reprogramming is a well-studied mechanism that mostly erases these changes.  
- There is **no definitive proof** in humans that many acquired, adult-life epigenetic modifications are passed reliably over multiple generations.  
- Still, recent model system work, improved tracking of epigenetic marks, and better observational designs are bringing us closer to answering the question.
