<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
My work as a clinical scientist and genome analyst at Vancouver General Hospital focuses on using genomic technologies—like long-read sequencing and optical genome mapping—to improve diagnostics for blood cancers and rare genetic disorders. I completed my PhD in Genome Science and Technology at UBC, where I now also teach as a Clinical Instructor in the Faculty of Medicine.
