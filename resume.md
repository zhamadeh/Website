<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My work as a clinical scientist and genome analyst at Vancouver General Hospital focuses on using genetic sequencing and bioinformatics to support cancer diagnostics and research. I completed my PhD in Genome Science and Technology at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where I also hold a faculty appointment as a Clinical Instructor in the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine. I'm currently pursuing my MD at UBC as part of the Class of 2028.
