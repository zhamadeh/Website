	I'm a Vancouver-based computational biologist with a PhD in Genome Science from the University of British Columbia. My scientific interests include cancer genomics, genetic sequencing and bioinformatics.
<br><br><br>

	My doctoral dissertation focused on exploring the ways in which DNA repair is perturbed in cancer using single-cell genomic sequencing. This work primarily focused on addressing the need for tools that can uncover the incredible amount of genetic diversity that exists within cancer, being largely a genetic disease. My other interests and pursuits include competing in Canada's top beach volleyball tour after having played 5 years of varsity indoor volleyball during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I also work with kids in a few different settings, mostly coaching, tutoring and science outreach.
