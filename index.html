	My name is Zeid Hamadeh. I'm an Arab-Canadian completing my PhD in Genome Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver since 2018. My research focuses on cancer, being largely a genetic disease, addressing the need for tools that can uncover the incredible amount of genetic diversity that exists within cancer genomes. I spend most of my time at BC Cancer Research Centre developing new bioinformatic tools to study the genomes of indivudal cancer cells.

	When I'm not in the lab looking at cancer genomes, I compete in British Columbia's top beach volleyball tour after having played indoor volleyball at the varsity level for 5 years at Western University and UBC. I also work with kids in a few different settings, mostly coaching, tutoring and science outreach. And finally, I like making videos about volleyball and writing articles on cool topcics in science!
