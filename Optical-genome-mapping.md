### Overview  
At Vancouver General Hospital’s Cytogenomics Laboratory, I’ve helped drive the **validation, implementation, and dissemination** of **Optical Genome Mapping (OGM)** as a frontline diagnostic for hematologic malignancies, including acute leukemias. This work spans clinical validation studies, platform comparisons, and integration with long-read sequencing, alongside broad conference dissemination and a forthcoming peer-reviewed manuscript.

### Clinical validation & implementation  
- Led and contributed to the **clinical validation** of OGM as a **front-line diagnostic test** for hematological neoplasms.  
- Advanced **platform benchmarking** (Stratys vs. Saphyr) to inform real-world deployment and workflow decisions.  

### Publications  
- **Clinical Validation of Optical Genome Mapping as a Front-Line Diagnostic Test for Hematological Neoplasms** — manuscript pending publication.  
- Additional genomics work includes methods and applications papers that underpin expertise in structural variation and genome instability.  

### Conferences & abstracts (selected)  
- **ACMG 2024 (Platform):** Canadian lab’s clinical validation experience using OGM as a front-line diagnostic.  
- **Bionano Showcase @ ACMG 2024 (Platform):** Inter-platform comparison of **Stratys vs. Saphyr**.  
- **ESHG 2024 (Poster, Berlin):** Canadian experience applying OGM to hematologic neoplasms.  
- **CGC 2024 (Poster):** Preliminary results of OGM **clinical verification** in hematologic cancers.  
- **ASH 2024 (Poster):** **Standard-of-care** OGM — diagnostic & clinical impacts ~10 months post-implementation.  
- **AMP 2024 (Posters):**  
  - Turnaround time comparison: **Karyotyping vs. OGM** in acute leukemia diagnostics.  
  - Novel **TKI-sensitive PDGFRB** fusion detected via **OGM + Nanopore**.  
- **CCMG 2024 (Abstract):** Lessons learned after deploying OGM as a first-line diagnostic.  
- **CCMG 2023 (Talk & Poster):** OGM for cryptic **KMT2A** rearrangements; early Canadian experience.  
- **ASH 2023 (Poster):** Additional diagnostic yield using OGM in **69 informative AL cases** (single-center).  

### Grants & collaboration  
- **Precision Health Catalyst (Co-I):** Combining **rapid targeted gene sequencing** with **high-resolution OGM** to optimize therapy selection in **AML**.  
- Ongoing collaborations across VGH Cytogenomics on **method development, platform evaluation,** and **clinical reporting**.  

### Impact & next steps  
Our OGM program has accelerated detection of clinically relevant structural variants and informed treatment discussions for hematologic cancers. Current efforts focus on **expanding OGM** beyond acute leukemias (e.g., **MDS**, relapsed leukemias, CLL) and deepening **integration with long-read sequencing** for comprehensive genome profiling.
